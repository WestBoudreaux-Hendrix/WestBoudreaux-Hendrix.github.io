            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Traveling is often closley tied to family. Whether you are traveling to visit or going on a trip with them,
                family is in the mix one way or another. Pets are a part of many families, and their comfort and safety is just 
                important as any other family members. Many airports have strict rules when it comes to bringing an animal along 
                with you for travel. On top of these rules, there are few, if any, accomodations made for animal companions. Our 
                goal at Animal Airways is to create an environment that is safe and comfortable for all parties involved. We have 
                integrated effeciency, security, and enjoymenmt into our travel experience both in the airport and on the plane
                . Choose the best option to fly with all of your loved ones. Choose Animal Airways.
