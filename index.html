            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Traveling is often closley tied to family. Whether you are traveling to visit or going on a trip with them,
                family is in the mix one way or another. Pets are a part of many families, and their comfort and safety is just 
                important as any other family members. Many airports have strict rules when it comes to bringing an animal along 
                with you for travel. On top of these rules, there are few, if any, accomodations made for animal companions. Our 
                goal at Animal Airways is to create an environment that is safe and comfortable for all parties involved. We have 
                integrated effeciency, security, and enjoymenmt into our travel experience both in the airport and on the plane
                . Choose the best option to fly with all of your loved ones. Choose Animal Airways.

            <h2>Available Accomodations</h2>
            <p id="accomodationStyle">Animal Airways has a number of accomodations to elevate you and your pets 
                experience to the next level. The map above shows the location of our major accomodations.
                Below, you will find a more in depth explaination of each.

            <strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Conveniently located near each terminal, we have large relief zones for your animals. To ensure that we suit the
                needs of a variety of different animals, each relief area is equipped with a small pond, litter boxs, sand, dirt, tree,
                and grass. After a long flight, or even a short one, you can rest easy knowing that relief is just around the corner for 
                your animal companion(s). 
              </li>
              <li>
                Located in the center of our lovely airport you can find the nature area. A large layered synthetic rubber
                track surrounds a relief area that is approximately five times larger than the others. Within you can find 
                three different types of tree (oak, birch, and pine), a fresh water pond, a salt water pond, a koi pond, grass, 
                dirt, and sand.
              </li>
              <li>
                At the northern-most edge of the airport you can find a food court dedicated to the animals you love.
                A wide assortment of diets are serviced here and everything is ethically sourced. Wheter you need to grab a quick
                snack on the go, or you have time to sit and relax for a moment, the food court's got you covered. Each vendor 
                also sells food that you can eat, typically paired with the dish type you get for you pet. Each day, vendor-specific 
                chefs prepare a rotating special menu item.
              </li>
              <li>
                In both the north-west and south-east corners of the airport you will find the refreshment area. Here you can refill 
                yours and your pets water. If you are looking for a space to just relax away from the hustle and bustle of the airport,
                this is the place to go. Each corner has four solitary rooms for people and animals that need thier own space for a moment.
                Reservations can be made beforehand, or availale rooms can simple be occupied on a firt-come-first-serve basis.
